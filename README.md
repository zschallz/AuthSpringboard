AuthSpringboard
===============

AuthSpringboard is a secure authentication system written in Java using Spring Security.

Currently this project serves as an example of a database-based login system that supports password salting and hashing using SHA-512. Eventually, once completed, this project could serve as a useful Springboard for others to start projects on top of.

Eventually, this project could evolve into a robust login system based on Spring Security similar to Devise for Ruby.
